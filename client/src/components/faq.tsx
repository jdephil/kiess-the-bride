          The wedding is formal, with a caveat from the bride that looking hot supersedes the dress
          code.

          The wedding itself is adults-only, but feel free to bring your kids to other events
          throughout the weekend. Just note there will be no babysitting services provided. If you
          need one, let Jen know so she can connect you with other parent-guests in the same
          situation.
        </p>
        <p className="my-5 ">
          Jen & Chris are obsessed with your pets, and while Blue Moon is technically dog-friendly,
          we kindly ask that you leave your dog at home if you are staying on site with us.

        <p className="my-5 ">
          There is limited parking at the venue so if you are not staying onsite, it is strongly
          encouraged to take the shuttle.

          Deep Creek uber/taxi service is "very limited to non-existent" according to the venue so
          please keep that in mind as well.
